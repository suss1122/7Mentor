    <p>International cricket matches are played between the teams representing their nations, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The main forms are Test matches, One-Day matches and Twenty20 matches.
    Most games are played <strong>as parts of <em>"tours"</em> when one nation travels to another for a </strong>number of weeks or months and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. The ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the Cricket World Cup & ICC T20 World Cup.</p>
